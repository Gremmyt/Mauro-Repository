    <h1>RestFul API Library</h1>
    <p>This project aims to emulate the functionality of a library where basic CRUD operations can be performed. Additionally, it implements complementary features such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>General MVC structure:</h2>
            <p>Utilizes the Model-View-Controller design pattern to organize and manage the application logic.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Usage of a PostgreSQL database:</h2>
            <p>Stores and manages information using PostgreSQL as the database management system.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Tests conducted with Mockito and JUnit:</h2>
            <p>Unit tests have been created using Mockito and JUnit to ensure the proper functioning of the system's functionalities.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Documentation of the function of different endpoints:</h2>
            <p>Detailed documentation has been generated regarding the function and usage of each of the API endpoints to facilitate understanding and usage by developers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Use of DTOs to protect information if necessary:</h2>
            <p>Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are used to encapsulate and protect information sent or received through the API, ensuring the security and privacy of data.</p>
        </li>
